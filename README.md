This is an EXTREMELY, *EXTREMELY* early version of a more epic game I'm making.

  How to Install
  
After downloading, click setup.exe to start it.
Of course, this only works on Windows, although it CAN be done with Windows XP.

  How to Play
  
Arrow Keys to move, and ZXC to shoot. Try to attain a high score.
Currently, Z shoots 3 spread-out bullets, X shoots a single, powerful bullet that depletes all of your charge meter, and C shoots a single weak bullet that doesn't cost much charge.

There are currently 5 types of enemies.

If you're having trouble trying to find the player, it's the only thing that directly responds to your movement.
